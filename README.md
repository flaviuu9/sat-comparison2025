# SAT Comparison 2025

This repository contains a comparative implementation of four classical SAT (Boolean Satisfiability) solving algorithms:

- Resolution
- Davisâ€“Putnam (DP)
- Davisâ€“Putnamâ€“Logemannâ€“Loveland (DPLL)
- Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL)

The purpose is educational â€” to understand and evaluate the theoretical and practical behavior of each solver across different SAT problem instances.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `cdcl.py`: CDCL solver (basic clause learning + backjumping)
- `dpll.py`: DPLL solver
- `dp.py`: Davisâ€“Putnam solver
- `resolution.py`: Resolution-based solver
- `parser.py`: DIMACS CNF parser
- `run_all.py`: Script that runs all solvers and logs the output
- `results.txt`: Output results (runtime, SAT/UNSAT, etc.)
- `benchmarks/`: SATLIB benchmark files (CNF)
